# otplike

otplike is a library on top of core.async, designed to create asynchronous
programs in Clojure. It implements Erlang/OTP concepts, such as process linking,
monitoring, standard behaviors and supervision.

## Documentation

### Rationale

Although core.async provides a solid low-level foundation for asynchronous
applications, the practical experience shows that there is a need for higher
level features which may be required to create reliable systems. We believe
that certain aspects taken from Erlang/OTP can be implemented on top of
core.async. The `gen_server` equivalent is used to serialize sync/async access
to state and ensure that possibly inconsistent state data will be discarded
in case of a crash. Process linking/monitoring improves crash/error propagation
and supervision covers system recovery. In addition process/message tracing
facility helps a lot with application debugging and profiling. It is obvious
that due to JVM limitations otplike cannot replace Erlang/OTP, and certain
compromises must be made to get it working.

## Known issues

* A chain of N processes, when each next process is created by the previous one,
holds amount of memory proportional to N _until last process exits_.
